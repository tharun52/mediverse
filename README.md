# Mediverse Chatbot

## Overview

- Traditional medicine websites can be complex, hindering user understanding. Our solution introduces a chat-based platform for a more user-friendly experience.
- Patients often have many questions about medicines and obtaining timely answers can be a lengthy process. Our project provides real-time guidance through an AI-powered chatbot.
- Mistakenly taking incorrect dosages or medications is dangerous and critical. This chatbot can offer guidance, minimizing the risk of inappropriate usage.
- Illegible doctor prescriptions create confusion among patients. A handwriting model can recognize the doctor's prescription and take orders accordingly.
- Certain medications may have adverse interactions, presenting health risks. By using the user's purchase history, the chatbot prevents complications by offering personalized recommendations.
